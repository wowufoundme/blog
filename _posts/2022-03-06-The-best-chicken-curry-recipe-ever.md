Wow, I am writing after so long. But a lot of things happened over the past few months or you could say years. The biggest one being Covid striking the whole world out. But I am finally in the city of dreams, yes, it is New York City and after moving to the States, I realized one thing that "Man, you can never get the same Indian taste here!". It's true. It just doesn't feel the same. So one day I dial my mom and ask her if she could send me her recipe of the chicken she makes at home and baam, she sends me three images of her recipe in her 'not-so-neat' handwriting and I started on a quest to try my best to make that chicken and it finally happened.  
  
So, I just wanted to share this with all the folks out there who are busy with studies or work and missing that 'tadka-wala-ghar-ka-bana-chicken'. Yep, so let's go! And remember to bring your SPOTIFY along because we will be timing everything to songs. Let's do this.

Let's start with the ingredients. Remember to adjust the quantity as per your needs and buy things like spices or veggies that are required beforehand. I'll try and attach some images for the ingredients so that you don't get confused.

## Recipe
  
1. Let's start then! Take a pressure cooker. If you don't have that, then try a large pot, anything in which you will easily be able to stir the chicken will work. <br/><br/>
2. Start by pouring in 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the pan and heating the oil for about 2 minutes on medium flame. Now drop (not the bass xD but...) 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and 3-4 chillies in the oil. You can put more chillies if you want the mixture to be _smokin'-hot-spicy_ but this much should be good. Let them fry for about 5-7 mins. The chillies will start losing their red color. <br/><br/>
3. **Be careful in this step as hot oil pops out of the pot.** Pour in the chopped onions, all of them, slowly. And then start mixing them. You just have to make sure that the all the chopped onions basically get layered with onions so mix them well. Use the circular method of mixing by rotating in the clockwise direction. Again be careful, it's hot oil. Let the onions turn slightly brown which can take like upto 10 minutes,if it doesn't increase the flame a little bit and wait for 3-4 minutes more, they may seem a bit reduced in quantity, like moist. <br/><br/>
4. Reduce the flame to low and pour the chicken pieces. On top of it, add the diced tomatoes and then add 2 teaspoons of Ginger-Garlic paste, 1 teaspoon Haldi (Turmeric powder), 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder, 3 teaspoons of Chicken Masala (Chicken Spice) and 1 teaspoon of salt. Blend the contents of the pot in circular fashion so that everything get mixed properly. Continue mixing for about 2 mins slowly and round and round round. Make sure your chicken pieces are layered somewhere between the onions mixture. This allows the chicken and spices to blend well and also cooks the chicken. <br/><br/>
5. Now is the important step. Mix the contents, rotating clockwise everytime in about 5-7 minute interval for about **35-40 minutes**. So you mix it well, play a song, grab a movie cutscene from Youtube or whatever you want to do (but just don't forget), then let it stand still keeping the flame medium, then again mix, then wait, then mix and wait. <br/><br/> 
5. After about the time, check the smell, oooof! It's gonna be amazing. To check if the chicken is cooked try piercing through any of the pieces, if it's moist just like how you eat it, it's done and ready! <br/><br/> 
6. Additionally you can garnish it with a few coriander leaves but just serve it with hot rice or chapatti/rotis (Indian bread) while watching a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and just dive into it(not the show, the food).

Hope you enjoyed this recipe! Have a great day!
